# Tips:

- Look at the color of the water tiles. The darker blue the deeper you're going to need to dive.
- Read the hints after you dive. Utilize the compass to orient yourself to what direction to keep looking.
- Try to go for shallow tiles first, you don't want to run out of air.
- Use the compass at the top to help guide you to the nearest treasure.
